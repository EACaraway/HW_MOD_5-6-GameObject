# HW_MOD_5-6-GameObject
Create two classes one called GameObject and another called Ghost. GameObject needs to have properties for X and Y velocities and the following method:
Public virtual void Collision(GameObject HitObj){â€¦}

As long as velocities change after collisions, it works for this assignment.

The Ghost class should be a GameObject that only changes velocity if it collides with another Ghost.
